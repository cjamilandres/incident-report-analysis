# incident-report-analysis
This project documents the analysis and response to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack involving a high volume of ICMP packets targeting an organization’s internal network. The incident resulted in service disruption and was traced back to a misconfigured firewall that allowed malicious traffic to overwhelm network resources.

The project focuses on incident identification, analysis, response, and recovery, following a structured security framework.
